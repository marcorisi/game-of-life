## Conway's Game of Life, build with Vue.js

*Discovering Vue while building something.*

I wanted to play with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and I thought that building the [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) would have been a nice task to start with.  
This project allowed me to learn the Vue fundamentals.  
I also wanted to explore the Flux pattern, so I decided to use [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/intro.html) as the state management library of the app.
